Task: Developing Python code using IBM Quantum QISKit for my quantum algorithms for protein structure prediction. 

The code presented here is partly included in my dissertation "Application of Quantum Computing to ab initio Protein Structure Prediction" (February, 2020). This project is ongoing. 

**_ccrca-circuit-2bit_**: implementation of doubly controlled quantum ripple-carry adder for sequences of length 2

**_ccrca-circuit-3bit_**: implementation of doubly controlled quantum ripple-carry adder for sequences of length 3

**_ccrca-nbit_**: implementation of doubly controlled quantum ripple-carry adder for arbitrary sequences of length greater than 3 (modified from Cuccaro et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410184, skips the most significant summation bit)

**_4-qubit-Grover-with-ancilla-bit_**: my implementation of Grover's algorithm for 4 qubits that uses one ancilla bit. The marked solution is 1001. 

**_psp-2d-2bit-generate-conformational-space_**: implementation of an algorithm for generating conformational space for sequences of length 2 in two-dimensional model

**_psp-2d-3bit-generation-of-conformational-space_**: implementation of an algorithm for generating conformational space for sequences of length 3 in two-dimensional model
