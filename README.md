# Quantum algorithm for protein structure prediction

This notebook contains the accompanying code for the paper:
R. Wong and W-L. Chang, 
"Fast quantum algorithm for protein structure prediction in hydrophobic-hydrophilic model", 
Parallel and Distributed Computing 164:178-190, 2022, DOI: 10.1016/j.jpdc.2022.03.011.

This notebook is incomplete and under active development. 

# Notes on use
For simplicity, this notebook requires the user to change manually the variable j specifying the expected energy (= number of hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts in the lattice). The present value of j is 1 as this is the expected energy level for the amino acid sequence PHPPH (encoded as 01001). 

# Acknowledgement
This work benefited greatly from discussions with Prof. Weng-Long Chang (National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology) and Dr. Aoyu Zhang (AWS). All remaining deficiencies are my own.
